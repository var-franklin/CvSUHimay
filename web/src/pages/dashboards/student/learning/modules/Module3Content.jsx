      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Fast food restaurants, hotels, and food catering houses require fish fillets for the
        preparation of convenience foods such as battered and breaded fish, fish fingers, burgers,
        and other popular dishes. The preparation of fillets requires great care and strict
        conditions of hygiene to ensure food safety and quality.

        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
          The fillet, once cut from the body of the fish, will be very susceptible to bacterial
          action on its large exposed surface area. Unlike whole fish where skin provides
          protection, fillets have maximum surface exposure to potential contamination. Strict
          hygiene is absolutely essential throughout the entire filleting process.
