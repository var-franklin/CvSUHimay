        Milkfish is usually sold in the "wet" market and supermarket fresh and frozen in the round
        (whole) or semi-processed (split or deboned). Milkfish is a spiny or bony fish, and this
        is one of the reasons why people, especially children, object to eating this fish.

          Deboning or removal of bones is done to improve its acceptability to a wider range of
          consumers. The complex bone structure of milkfish, particularly its notorious Y-shaped
          intermuscular spines, makes deboning a valuable skill that significantly increases the
          market value and appeal of the product.

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-zinc-300">

            Split the fish down the <strong className="text-gray-900 dark:text-zinc-100">dorsal
            side</strong> (back of the fish, not the belly). Make a clean cut along the top of the
            fish, following the backbone. Then turn the knife flat and extend the cut from the tail
            to the head by running the edge along the backbone.

            Lay the fish flat on its skin with the flesh side facing up. Hold the knife horizontally
