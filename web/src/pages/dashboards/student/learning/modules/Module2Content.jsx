      <H2>1. Ways of Preparing Fish</H2>
      <p className="text-sm ink-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The methods of preparing "wet" whole or round fish (fish which has not been gutted or the
        viscera removed) either for chilling, freezing, or processing vary according to the specific
        requirements of the user. Each method serves different purposes and markets, from simple home
        preparation to complex commercial applications.

        <p className="text-sm ink-muted leading-relaxed">
          Different fish preparations optimize the product for specific cooking methods, consumer
          preferences, storage requirements, and market demands. The right preparation method
          enhances both culinary quality and economic value.

        Fish that has been eviscerated or the entrails removed. This is the most basic preparation
