// Dorsal-cut geometry + validator.
//
// Geometry is a STRAIGHT line from head to tail along the longest horizontal
// axis of the fish's bounding box, at ~80 % of the fish height (the dorsal
// ridge). No curve fitting — the canonical milkfish deboning procedure cuts
// a straight line, and a straight line is trivial for students to trace.
//
// Everything is computed ONCE at GLB load — zero per-frame allocation

// scene that has been pre-scaled + rotated to match FishModel.
//
// samples    — 2 THREE.Vector3 endpoints (head, tail). Straight line.
